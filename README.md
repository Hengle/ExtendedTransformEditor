# Extended Transform Inspector

An extended version of the default Transform editor with no wasted space.

You can snap it to the ground or set a random rotation from the contex menu.
The position, rotation and scale can be reset from small reset buttons to the right of the fields.
The scale can be uniformly changed by dragging on the "Scale" label as if it was a float field.
