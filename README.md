# Extended Transform Inspector

An extended version of the default Transform editor with no wasted space.

You can snap the selected transforms to the ground or set a random rotation from the contex menu.
The position, rotation and scale can all be reset from small buttons to the right of each field.
The scale can be uniformly changed by dragging on the "Scale" label as if it was a float field.
